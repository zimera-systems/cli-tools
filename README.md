# cli-tools

## About 

This repo consists of scripts/cli which I created to ease my daily computing life. I usually use [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/), occasionally use [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), and rarely use [Zsh](http://zsh.org/). I might also create binary executable using some compilers. Please check each README files.

* [git-pull-all](git-pull-all/): a script in Bash and Fish shell to iterate through some directories and go `git pull` in each dir. There's a report at the end.
* [zig-master-update](zig-master-update/): a script in Fish shell to update [Zig](https://ziglang.org) binary master.
